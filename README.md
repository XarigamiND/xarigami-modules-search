# XarigamiND Search Module

 Search is runs the search on your website. The search module does not provide any search data. It is currently responsible for:

* processing gui search form data provided by other modules that have a search hook
* displaying the search results passed from modules that offer a search hook
* provide some configuration to display last X searches.
